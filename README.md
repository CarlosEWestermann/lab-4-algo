# lab-4-algo

## How to Run

To run the Hungarian algorithm implementation with an input file from the `test_instances` directory, use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
make
./hungarian < test_instances/instance_0000_n100_min.txt

```

## Note

removed larger test files as github would allow pushing them
